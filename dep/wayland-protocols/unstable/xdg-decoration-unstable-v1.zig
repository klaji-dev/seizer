/// This interface allows a compositor to announce support for server-side
/// decorations.
/// 
/// A window decoration is a set of window controls as deemed appropriate by
/// the party managing them, such as user interface components used to move,
/// resize and change a window's state.
/// 
/// A client can use this protocol to request being decorated by a supporting
/// compositor.
/// 
/// If compositor and client do not negotiate the use of a server-side
/// decoration using this protocol, clients continue to self-decorate as they
/// see fit.
/// 
/// Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
/// backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
/// may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
/// Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
/// the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
/// Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
/// version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
/// interface version number is reset.
